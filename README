Merged Mining
-------------
Eloipool supports merged mining using the setworkaux/gotwork RPC interface.
A simple port of namecoin's merged-mine-proxy to this interface is included and modified to allow more AUX chains:

Dependencies
------------
Python 2.7
python-twisted
	
Please be advised that:
- Eloipool does not provide any interface for longpolling aux chains.
- Empty and longpoll merkle roots are generated only as-needed, and will NOT be
  regenerated when CoinbaseAux changes. This means shares found by getwork
  miners after a longpoll will almost always be stale on your aux chain(s).
  This problem does not affect GBT or stratum miners.
